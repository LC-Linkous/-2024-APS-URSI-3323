## Requirements
* The majority of this project is designed to run in Google Colab with Jupyter Notebook. You must have a Google account to run these tutorials as-is. The Jupyter Notebook files in this repository run individually. Library requirements for each tutorial may vary. Refer to a tutorial for the specific requirements.

* Linked repositories featuring optimizers have their own requirements, and will require a Python environment.


## How to Use
* To run, you will need to create a folder in your Google Drive, and add the specified datasets  and all tutorials into the same folder.
